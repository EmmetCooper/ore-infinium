In order to use Ore Infinium, you must compile it..for now (I don't have time to make
binaries each day). Before you can do that, you must install the following:

IMPORTANT: this game requires at least OpenGL 3.0 or newer. You can figure this
out usually by running 'glxinfo'.

Linux's Mesa drivers (9.x or so) work great in my experience, at least on an
r600 chipset (AMD 6870).

(so open source drivers won't work on Linux, for example. At least not until
I can (hopefully) support older GL versions). All things in due time.

To get started building this on Kubuntu (which is what I'm using as a test
machine, and is, as a rule, a good base for shipping software), you can install
some packages so that you don't have to build all of them yourself.


Here's a list, just to keep in mind. Commands are further down.

* SDL 2.x http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php (yet unreleased)

* protobuf (google's libprotobuf. needs both the library and the 'protoc'
binary, which e.g. ubuntu ships in a separate package

* enet (networking lib)

* GLEW

* libRocket (GUI HTML/CSS C++ library)

* FreeType (librocket already requires that so if you have that you should be
fine).

* OpenAL-Soft >= 1.14

* C++11 compatible compiler (at least GCC 4.7 is fine and clang 3.2). MSVC is
particularly a retarded cousin of other compilers, so you can likely forget
about that compiling for several years, as is the case with most projects.

* YAML-CPP (0.3.0. NOT GREATER THAN. Newer versions like 0.5 have a new API
which I unfortunately cannot yet use as evidently, nothing ships it yet, not
until the next version of ubuntu). Kind of a pain in the ass, but whatever.

* Chipmunk physics library (http://chipmunk-physics.net) >= 6.1

* ZLib (for compression, for both my network packets and file saving, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------


If you're running Ubuntu 13.04 (which is what I support the most), then type:

'apt-get install libenet-dev libglew-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
libyaml-cpp-dev zlib1g-dev libopenal-dev'

And just to make sure, if you've never done development, you probably need to
run:

'apt-get install mercurial git cmake'

Okay, so basically this gives us everything except the following:

* SDL 2.0(which is unreleased right now

and

* librocket

So those need to be built from source.
