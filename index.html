    <h3>Ore Infinium</h3>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>

    <p>
    Ore Infinium is a game that is greatly inspired by Terraria, but of course aims to
    be a hell of a lot more. One way to describe it is a 2D Dungeon Crawler/Sandbox, with also an emphasis on survival. You can mine blocks,
    minerals, build houses, caves, and all sorts of neato things.
    <br>
    Community is a huge part of development behind this project (hence why it's
    on github in the first place. Feel free to poke the code, make some art, and
    fiddle with what you can find ;)

    </p>

    <h3>Why is it?</h3>

    <p>
    It is a project that is open source from the very beginning, as improving upon
    the neat ideas that Terraria introduced to the world when it released,
    taking input and help from the community, and making our ideas a reality.
    <br>

    <br>

    It is written in SDL (just for audio, input and OpenGL context), OpenGL
    and C++, so is cross-platform and very fast (I use all hardware
    accelerated rendering)
    <br>

    <ul>
    <li>It will have modding capabilities</li><br>

    <li>It will have loads of features that I missed and I'm sure some others have as well.</li><br>

    <li>It's an ongoing project, not an end goal. And in the event that I get hit by a bus tomorrow, feel free to fork it and pick it up!</li><br>

    <li>Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, with long-term plans for Android)</li><br>

    <li>Many, many features are planned that people only dreamed of for Terraria to have.</li><br>

    <li>Community driven. I'm very open to code reviews, patches, and constructive criticism, bug and feature requests, etc.</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What license is it under?</h3>
    <p>
    All assets are required (by me ;) to be under a Free and Open license.

    The code is presently under GPLv2+ as that seems to be the licence
    I like the most.
    </p>

    <h3>What platforms will it run on?</h3>

    <p>
    The goal initially is to make it run on Linux/Unixen, Mac OS X and Windows.
    <br>
    I don't want to force anyone onto a platform just to play our game.
    <br>

    I would love to see it run on Android for instance. But for this to happen
    I'd need to run through all of my code base and make sure it runs just fine
    on OpenGL ES 2.0. Not to mention compiles and all my dependencies work on it.
    <br>

    In theory it should work just fine, and just require a bit of OpenGL tweaking
    for it (an official port with a proper Android interface notwithstanding).
    <br>

    I'll worry about getting more into porting to Android after I get something
    usable on the desktop. Patches welcome ;-)
    </p>

    <h3>Current Status</h3>
    <p>
    The project is very, very preliminary right now. If there was a word for
    pre-alpha, I would use it to describe this.

    <br>
    But of course, it's progressing quite quickly over just the few weeks it has
    existed

    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    I did have a working tilemap rendering fragment shader..which uses some neat
    tricks to render it all in super fast manner.
    </li>

    <li>
    And as I'm typing this, I'm researching on how to further revamp the tilemap
    renderer, and implement the background (underground, and walls), in addition
    to making the foreground tiles meshable (cleanly, seamless).

    <br>
    The design I'm planning on allows for *a lot* more flexibility than Terraria
    had. It means that not only is it fast and efficient on hardware, which gives me
    breathing room to add more features whereever I can, but tiles blend together
    very nicely based on neighboring tiles. This means that Worlds can be totally
    different in design, but still look great.
    </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>How can I help out?</h3>

    <p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Merge requests/patches. They will need to match my coding style, which isn't too
    difficult (and there's an astyle script at the root directory for ease of use).
    And of course, fix the issue.

    <br>
    I love features, so chances are I'm going to accept
    your patch if it does the job nicely. I'm not too overlordy when it comes to code.
    <br>
    Oh and of course, all other assets are *most* welcome. Of course, they'll also
    have to be released under a free license.
    </li><br>

    <li>Coding style:  http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style use astyle.sh file to automatically format everything to this. I'll do so ruthlessly every so often. I'd rather have clean code than easy history</li><br>

    <li>Edit the Wiki on here (github)!</li><br>

    <li>Submit issues and feature requests on the issue tracker on github!</li><br>

    <li>Test, test, test!</li><br>

    <li>ART! Please give me all of your art :-)</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Contact?</h3>
    <p>
    We have an irc channel on chat.freenode.net #ore-infinium, feel free to drop in for
    chilling, devel questions, user questions...or whatever.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I install it?</h3>

    <p>
    Read the INSTALL file and it will show all the dependencies I use and where to
    get them, and hopefully how to install them ;-)
    <br>

    After this is installed and you have followed their directions, to get my code,
    you can either click download the zip, or run `git clone git://github.com/sreich/ore-infinium.git`
    <br>

    After you have my code, go to the top directory of it, `mkdir build; cd build;`
    and now to actually build it
    <br>
    </p>

    <h3>System Requirements</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>

    <li>SDL 2.x (yet unreleased) (and SDL_mixer)</li><br>

    <li>Platform of Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X</li><br>

    <li>
    Minimum RAM of 250 MiB. Ore Infinium  uses so far.. an average of 60 MiB RES.
    <br>
    This will change with world size, since we don't have chunk based loading
    (yet?), Currently the size of the Block class is 2 bytes (2 unsigned chars).
    Which means for a 8400x2600 map (the default, soft minimum), (8400 \* 2600 \*
    2 bytes = ~44 MiB). 
    <br>
    Presently, to run the game it's about 60MiB of RAM usage on
    average. Subject to change, of course.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    GPU and drivers capable of OpenGL 3.2+ (and hopefully OpenGL ES 2.0).
    <br>
    In other words, if your GPU/drivers say DirectX 10+ capable, or you can run
    DirectX 10+ games then that will work.
    </li><br>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Planned Features</h3>

    <p>
    Some of these plans are merely thoughts and things to experiment with, some are
    must haves and others are things that will hopefully come later. 

    <br>
    Of course, nothing is in stone.

    <ul>
    <li>Multiplayer (obviously, a must ;)</li><br>

    <li>Dungeons</li><br>

    <li>
    Ladders! Many games make it cumbersome to come up from your mining pit after
    you're done, often you end up dying because you slipped. Also, portals help
    fix that ;)
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Villages! (randomly generated). Think similar to Minecraft
    </li><br>

    <li>
    A nice tutorial system, or at least something brief to stay out of the
    player's way, but also give them help when they need it.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    NPCs/merchants you can "place" in your home.
    </li><br>

    <li>Teleporters/Portals! Seriously. This is a definite todo in my mind.</li><br>

    <li>
    Crafting system more simlar to Minecraft? Would people like that? Personally,
    I was not much of a fan for Terraria's crafting.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Menu system (HUD) that is easy to navigate. A lot of games suffer from that
    issue once they introduce crafting. The GUI/HUD will also be
    customizable/fully moddable, by YAML, which is a simple text format, and images.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Full modding support (another must). This will have to be a later feature
    though of course, until I get a good amount of content into the game.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Android and in general, a mobile port? This is very much long term though. Also, I don't have a tablet.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Dynamic 2D lighting and shadow system, versus Terraria's very simplistic
    tile-based lighting.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Will use some of the very useful outlets of independent music developers,
    and have a big selection of in-game music, just so that you don't get sick of
    the soundtracks while building that awesome castle of yours.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Water...and I'd also like to make it pressure based, but that's going to
    be a lot more work as well
    </li><br>

    <li> Weather system - Rain, Snow</li><br>
    <br>
    </ul>

    </p>

        <h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
