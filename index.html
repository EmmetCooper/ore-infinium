    <h3>Ore Infinium</h3>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>

    Ore Infinium is a game that is greatly inspired by Terraria, but of course aims to
    be a hell of a lot more. One way to describe it is a 2D Dungeon Crawler/Sandbox, with also an emphasis on survival. You can mine blocks,
    minerals, build houses, caves, and all sorts of neato things.
    <br>
    Community is a huge part of development behind this project (hence why it's
    on github in the first place. Feel free to poke the code, make some art, and
    fiddle with what you can find ;)

    </p>

    <h3>Why is it?</h3>

    <p>
    It is a project that is open source , which aims at improving upon
    the neat ideas that Terraria introduced to the world when it released,
    taking input and help from the community, and making our ideas a reality.

    It is planned to be most interested in exploring the avenue that is
    available through science. So features that encourage base building and
    various gadgets/contraptions that really prolong the fun factor and the
    replayability.

    For instance, it will be focused on wiring/electricity and liquid plumbing.
    So generators whether solar or coal or geothermal (and more..) can power a
    base with all of its electrical lighting, electric doors, water/lava pumps,
    traps, switches, sensors, and so on.

    But when the player first starts out, they are practically in the stone age,
    having to rely on torches until finally creating electrical devices.
    <br>

    <br>

    It is written in C++, SDL, and OpenGL 3.2.
    So it's cross-platform and very fast.
    <br>

    <ul>
    <li>It will eventually have modding capabilities, but this isn't on the
agenda right now</li><br>

    <li>It's an ongoing project, not an end goal, so the focus is not on just
rushing and implementing horrendous code just so it works, but thinking of the
future and how future code will affect what is written.</li><br>

    <li>Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, with long-term plans for
Android, for tablets as that seems like a fun adventure)</li><br>

    <li>Community driven. Very open to code reviews, patches, and constructive criticism, bug and feature requests, etc.</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What license is it under?</h3>
    <p>
    The code is presently under GPLv2+ as that seems to be the licence
    we like the most.

    All assets are required (by me ;) to be under a Free and Open license.

    </p>

    <h3>What platforms will it run on?</h3>

    <p>
    It will run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, with future plans for Android
tablets.
    <br>
    We don't want to force anyone onto a platform just to play our game.
    <br>

    It'd be awesome to see it run on Android for instance. But for this to happen
    we'd need to run through all of my code base and make sure it runs just fine
    on OpenGL ES 2.0. Not to mention compiles and all the dependencies work on it.
    Then of course, we'd need a tablet. ;)
    <br>

    In theory it should work just fine, and just require a bit of OpenGL tweaking
    for it (an official port with a proper Android user interface notwithstanding).
    <br>

    </p>

    <h3>Current Status</h3>
    <p>
    The project is very, very preliminary right now. If there was a word for
    pre-alpha, we would use it to describe this.

    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    </li>

    <li>
    <br>
    The design that is in progress, allows for *a lot* more flexibility than Terraria
    had. It means that not only is it fast and efficient on hardware, which gives
    breathing room to add more features whereever we can, but tiles blend together
    very nicely based on neighboring tiles. This means that Worlds can be totally
    different in design, but still look great but without an extra burden on art
    design since it is done through code
    </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>How can I help out?</h3>

    <p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Merge requests/patches.

    <br>
    I love features, so chances are I'm going to accept
    your patch if it does the job nicely. I'm not too overlordy when it comes to code.
    <br>
    Oh and of course, all other assets are *most* welcome. Of course, they'll also
    have to be released under a free license.
    </li><br>

    <li>Coding style:  http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style use astyle.sh file to automatically format everything to this. I'll do so every so often. I'd rather have clean code than easy history</li><br>

    <li>Edit the Wiki on here (github)!</li><br>

    <li>Submit issues and feature requests on the issue tracker on github!</li><br>

    <li>Test, test, test!</li><br>

    <li>ART! Please give me all of your art :-)</li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Contact?</h3>
    <p>
    We have an irc channel on chat.freenode.net #ore-infinium, feel free to drop in for
    chilling, devel questions, user questions...or whatever.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I install it?</h3>

    <p>
    Read the INSTALL file and it will show all the dependencies that are in use and where to
    get them, and hopefully how to install them ;-)
    <br>

    After this is installed and you have followed their directions, to get the code,
    you can either click download the zip, or run `git clone git://github.com/sreich/ore-infinium.git`
    <br>

    After you have my code, go to the top directory of it, `mkdir build; cd build;`
    and now to actually build it
    <br>
    </p>

    <h3>System Requirements</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>

    <li>SDL 2.x (yet unreleased, they say it's expected in May 2013)</li><br>

    <li>Platform of Windows, Linux/Unix or Mac OS X</li><br>

    <li>
    Minimum RAM of 500 MiB (though it probably won't need more than half that).
    </li><br>

    <li>
    GPU and drivers capable of OpenGL 3.2+, which all cards within the past
    several years support it just fine.
    <br>
    In other words, if your GPU/drivers say DirectX 10+ capable, or you can run
    DirectX 10+ games then that should work just fine.
    </li><br>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Planned Features</h3>

    <p>
    Some of these plans are merely thoughts and things to experiment with, some are
    must haves and others are things that will hopefully come later. 

    <br>
    Of course, nothing is in stone.

    <ul>
    <li>Dungeons</li><br>

    <li>
    Ladders! Many games make it cumbersome to come up from your mining pit after
    you're done, often you end up dying because you slipped. Also, portals help
    fix that ;)
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Villages! (randomly generated). Think similar to Minecraft
    </li><br>

    <li>
    A nice tutorial system, or at least something brief to stay out of the
    player's way, but also give them help when they need it.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    NPCs/merchants you can "place" in your home.
    </li><br>

    <li>Teleporters! Seriously. This is a definite todo.</li><br>

    <li>
    Crafting system more similar to Minecraft, but built-in database of recipes
    so that it is easy to find what you need.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Menu system (HUD) that is easy to navigate. A lot of games suffer from that
    issue once they introduce crafting.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Full modding support (another must). This will have to be a later feature
    though of course, until there is a good amount of content into the game and
    mistakes of design have been made and learned from.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Android and in general, a mobile port. This is very much long term though. Also, I don't have a tablet.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Dynamic 2D lighting and shadow system, versus Terraria's very simplistic
    tile-based lighting.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Will use some of the very useful outlets of independent music developers,
    and have a big selection of in-game music, just so that you don't get sick of
    the soundtracks while building that awesome castle of yours.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Water...and I'd also like to make it pressure based, but that's going to
    be a lot more work as well
    </li><br>

    <li> Weather system - Rain, Snow</li><br>
    <br>
    </ul>
