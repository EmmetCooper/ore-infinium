    <h3>Ore Infinium</h3>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>

    Ore Infinium is a game that is greatly inspired by Terraria, but of course aims to
    be a hell of a lot more. One way to describe it is a 2D Dungeon Crawler/Sandbox, with also an emphasis on survival. You can mine blocks,
    minerals, build houses, caves, electricity, generators, wiring, plumbing,
    teleporters, sensors/switches, water pumps and all sorts of neato things.
    <br>
    Community is a huge part of development behind this project (hence why it's
    on github in the first place. Feel free to poke the code, make some art, and
    fiddle with what you can find ;)

    </p>

    <h3>Why is it?</h3>

    <p>
    It is a project that is open source, which aims at improving upon
    the neat ideas that Terraria introduced to the world when it released,
    taking input and help from the community, and making our ideas a reality.

    It is planned to be most interested in exploring the avenue that is
    available through science. So features that encourage base building and
    various gadgets/contraptions that really prolong the fun factor and the
    replayability.

    For instance, it will be focused on wiring/electricity and liquid plumbing.
    So generators whether solar or coal or geothermal (and more..) can power a
    base with all of its electrical lighting, electric doors, water/lava pumps,
    traps, switches, sensors, and so on.

    But when the player first starts out, they are practically in the stone age,
    having to rely on torches until finally creating electrical devices.
    <br>

    <br>

    It is written in C++, SDL, and OpenGL 3.2.
    So it's cross-platform and very fast.
